# Chat_Bot_NLP
## About The Project

[\* This was an academic project]

This Chat bot is used for:
* improving the reading comprehension capability of preschool children by making conversation between the user and the chatbot.
* helping parents cultivate the logical thinking capacity of their children during their worktime.

We use the **End-to-End Memory Neural Network Model**, which can be seen as an extension of our RNNs but with higher flexibility which lead to better performance for application.

**Built With**

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
* [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

**Data Source**

 *bAbI* Data Sets From *Facebook*
 
 We use bAbI data from Facebook. The total data is about 5.6mb, within 20 tasks. And the Longest sentence length is 12 words, the longest story length is 228 words.
